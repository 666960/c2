## gameplay-encoder
Command-line tool for encoding games assets like true-type fonts and 3D scene files
into a simple binary-based bundle file format for the gameplay 3D game framework runtime. 

## TrueType Font Support
TrueType Fonts conversion is enabled/built-in by default into gameplay-encoder via freetype 2 library.

## COLLADA Scene Support
COLLADA is enabled/built-in by default into gameplay-encoder via COLLADA-DOM library.
Most major 3D DCC tools support the export of COLLADA 1.4.
We also recommend you download and use OpenCOLADA (http://opencollada.org/)
for Autodesk Maya and 3DS Max.

## FBX Scene Support
FBX support can easily be enabled in gameplay-encoder but requires an 
additional installation of Autodesk FBX SDK. (http://www.autodesk.com/fbx).
You must then rebuild gameplay-encoder with the follow platform/tooling instructions:

### Building FBX Support on Windows 7 using Visual Studio 2010
- Download and install the FBX SDK for Window VS2010. (http://www.autodesk.com/fbx)
- Edit the project properties of "gameplay-encoder"
- Add Preprocessor Definition "USE_FBX" (C++/Preprocessor)
- Add the FBX SDK include directory to Additional Include Directories (C++/General)
  * Example: C:/Program Files/Autodesk/FBX/FbxSdk/2012.2/include
- Add the FBX lib directory to the Additional Library Directories (Linker/General)
  * Example: C:/Program Files/Autodesk/FBX/FbxSdk/2012.2/lib/vs2010/x86
- Add "fbxsdk-2012.2-mdd.lib" and "wininet.lib" to the Additional Dependencies (Linker/Input)
  * Example: fbxsdk-2012.2-mdd.lib;wininet.lib
- Add a post build event to copy the DLL (Build Events/Post-Build Event)
  * Example: copy /Y "C:\Program Files\Autodesk\FBX\FbxSdk\2012.2\lib\vs2010\x86\fbxsdk-2012.2d.dll" "$(TargetDir)"
- Build gameplay-encoder

### Building FBX Support on Mac OS X using XCode 4.3.2+
- Download and install the FBX SDK for Mac OS X (http://www.autodesk.com/fbx)
- Edit the project properties of target "gameplay-encoder".
- Add Preprocessor Macro "USE_FBX" to both Debug/Release sections. (Build Settings)
- Add the FBX include directory to Header Search Paths: (Build Settings)
  * Example: /Applications/Autodesk/FBXSDK20122/include
- Add the FBX library and dependency Library/Frameworks: (Build Phases -> Link Binary with Libraries)
  * Example: /Applications/Autodesk/FBXSDK20122/lib/gcc4/ub/libfbxsdk-2012.2-static.a  (Add Other)
  * Example: libiconv.dylib, Cocoa.framework, SystemConfiguration.framework
- Build gameplay-encoder

## Bundle File Format
The gameplay bundle file format is well defined in the gameplay-encoder/gameplay-bundle.txt file.

## Bundle File Loading
Bundle files can easily be loaded using the gameplay/Bundle.h which is part of the gameplay runtime framework.
