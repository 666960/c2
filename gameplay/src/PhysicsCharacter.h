/**
 * Physics controller class for a game character.
 *
 * This class can be used to control the movements and collisions of a character
 * in a game. It interacts with the Physics system to apply gravity and handle
 * collisions, however dynamics are not applied to the character directly by the
 * physics system. Instead, the character's movement is controlled directly by the
 * PhysicsCharacter class. This results in a more responsive and typical game
 * character than would be possible if trying to move a character by applying
 * physical simulation with forces.
 *
 * This class can also be used to control animations for a character. Animation
 * clips can be setup for typical character animations, such as walk, run, jump,
 * etc; and the controller will handle blending between these animations as needed.

     *
     * There are some limiations and considerations that should be ponited out when
     * playing animations:
     * <li>You should avoid playing multiple animations concurrently that have the same target.
     * For example, two animations targetting the character's joints should not be played 
     * concurrently, but it is fine to play one animation that targets the joints and another
     * that targets the character's Node.
     * <li>When playing an animation that targets the transform of the character's Node
     * (such as a motion path animation), the character's velocity vector should be set to
     * Vector3::zero() so that the PhysicsCharacter stops applying motion directly
     * and instead relies on the motion animation to control the character.
     *
     * The optional animation layer can be used to group animations on separate layers.
     * Each animation layer can have at most one active animation. Playing multiple
     * animations concurrently can be achieved by putting the different animations
     * on separate layers. For example, a motion path animation that targets the
     * character's Node can be put on one layer, while a running animation that targets
     * a character's Joints can be put on a separate layer. This allows a character's
     * movement to be animated at the same time as the run animation is playing.
     *
     * @param name Animation name, or NULL to stop all character animations on the given layer.
     * @param flags Animation flags from the AnimationFlags enumeration.
     * @param speed Optional animation speed (default is 1.0).
     * @param blendDuration Optional number of milliseconds to crossfade between the
     *      currently playing animation on the given layer and the new animation.
     * @param layer Optional animation layer.

     * Sets the velocity of the character.
     *
     * Calling this function sets the velocity (speed and direction) for the character.
     * The velocity is maintained until this method is called again. The final velocity
     * of the character is determined by product of the current velocity vector(s)
     * and the current character animation's move speed. Therefore, specifying a
     * normalized (unit-length) velocity vector results in the character speed being
     * controled entirely by the current animation's velocity; whereas the speed of
     * the character can be augmented by modifying the magnitude of the velocity vector.

     * Note that a zero velocity vector and/or a zero animation move speed will
     * result in no character movement (the character will be stationary). A zero
     * velocity vector should be used when playing an animation that targets the
     * character's transform directly (such as a motion path animation), since these
